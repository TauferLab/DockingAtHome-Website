<p>Docking@Home is a collaborative project between computer scientists and bioscientists, with specific goals in each discipline. From the bioscience point of view, the project aims to further knowledge of the atomic details of protein-ligand interactions and, by doing so, will <b>search for insights into the discovery of novel pharmaceuticals</b>. From the computer science point of view, this project aims to <b>extend volunteer computing to enable adaptive multi-scale modeling of the docking applications</b>. Different models that represent the same phenomena in nature with different levels of accuracy and resource requirements will be chosen at run-time based on results collected to date and identified characteristics of the protein-ligand complex.
