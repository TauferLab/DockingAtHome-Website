<h3>Is it safe to run Docking@Home?</h3> 
<p>
    Any time you download a program through the Internet you are taking a chance: the program might have dangerous errors, or the download server might have been hacked. Docking@Home has made efforts to minimize these risks. We have tested our applications carefully. Our servers are behind a firewall and are configured for high security. To ensure the integrity of program downloads, all executable files are digitally signed on a secure computer not connected to the Internet.
</p>
<p>
    The applications run by Docking@Home may cause some computers to overheat. If this happens, stop running Docking@Home or use a <a href="download_network.php">utility program</a> that limits CPU usage.
